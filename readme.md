# AWMan2

Arch Wiki Man 2

A project which attempts to recreate what
[greg-js/arch-wiki-man](https://github.com/greg-js/arch-wiki-man) does but
better.

## Why AWMan2?

It's one singular, simple shell script that does almost nothing and
shouldn't ever break.

AWMan2 is bundled with it's own man page, so have a look at
[wiki(1)](./wiki.1).

## Dependencies

### Pandoc

As the arch wiki is only available in HTML, but we want man pages,
pandoc is used to convert between them.

### Findutils and Grep

These are used for search wiki pages. Shouldn't be a particular foreign
concept.

### Man

Do I really have to explain this one?

### Bash

It's a bash script. What did you think it was gonna depend on?
